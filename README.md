# Introduction

For a general introduction into the open-decision project please have a look at: [Open-Decision](https://open-decision.org).

# Getting Started
> If you have any problems please open an issue in this repository and attach the error that is printed to the console in case a command fails.

## 0. Required Software

Please make sure that the following programs are installed locally on your machine.

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)

## 1. Clone the repo

Execute the following command in the directory of your choosing. This will create a subfolder open-decision-frontend. This is the project.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-decision/open-decision-frontend.git
```

## 2. Install dependencies

Open a terminal in the just created folder open-decision-frontend and execute the following command.

```bash
npm install
```

Npm is short for Node Package Manager and is part of NodeJS. This will install all the project dependencies locally. Install in this case does not mean an install on your machine, but in this project folder.

## 3. Open the project

Open the project folder in your prefered editor. To run the code for local development you can run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server and you can now visit localhost:3000 in your Browser to see the project.

# Things to note

This project is still very unstable and the codebase may change without warning. If you are interested in participating in development it is best you send a DM to **PhilGarb** on GitHub, because the current state of the project makes the normal PR - Merge workflow difficult.
