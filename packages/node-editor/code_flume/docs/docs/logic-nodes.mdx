So far we've created some basic nodes. We've created text, number, and boolean nodes, and a root node for the final output. While this is fine and well, let's take a minute and think about some nodes we could create that could make our editor more powerful. Here's a few ideas:

- A user node, that outputs attributes of the current user
- A time node that outputs the current time
- A text join node, that combines two strings of text
- Nodes representing mathmatical operations (+, -, *, รท)
- A find and replace node, for replacing strings of text
- Boolean operation nodes (and, or)
- A window node to expose attributes of the window
- Logical comparison nodes (greater than, less than, equals)

The kinds of nodes your present to your users are entirely up to you. When making this determination, ask yourself questions like,

- What kind of data inputs will my users need access to?
- What kind of logic will be intuitive for my users to use?
- What capabilities make sense to expose to the end user?

Let's get back to our example app.

## Adding logic nodes

Let's pick a few ideas from the list above.
