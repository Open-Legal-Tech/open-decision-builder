title: The Root Node
id: root-node

The root node is a special node that serves as the final output for our graph. If you've been following along from the previous examples, we're configuring a node editor to control the properties of a page on our website. The node that accepts these final properties is our root node.

## Adding a root node

Let's get started adding our root node. We want this node to represent the properties we'll use in our website. Let's head back to our `config.js` file.

```js
import { FlumeConfig, Colors, Controls } from 'flume'

const config = new FlumeConfig()
config
/*  ...  */
  .addRootNodeType({
    type: "homepage",
    label: "Homepage",
    inputs: ports => [
      ports.string({
        name: "title",
        label: "Title"
      }),
      ports.string({
        name: "description",
        label: "Description"
      }),
      ports.boolean({
        name: "showSignup",
        label: "Show Signup"
      }),
      ports.number({
        name: "copyrightYear",
        label: "Copyright Year"
      })
    ]
  })
```

You may notice a few things about the above example. First, instead of `addNodeType` we're using the `addRootNodeType` function, but the properties you pass to this function are the same. Under the hood, this node type is marked as the "root" node, and by default it can't be added or deleted in the node editor manually.

## Default nodes

Let's return to the node editor. After adding the root node, you should have what appears to be the same editor as before. If you right-click to add a node, the homepage node doesn't appear. Because this node is the root node, there should be exactly one of this node in the editor at all times. We don't want users to be able to add or delete this node, so we'll provide it to the editor as a default node.

In the file where we're rendering the node editor, we'll add a new prop called `defaultNodes`.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { NodeEditor } from 'flume'
import config from './config'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{width: 800, height: 600}}>
      <NodeEditor
        portTypes={config.portTypes}
        nodeTypes={config.nodeTypes}
        defaultNodes={[
          {
            type: "homepage",
            x: 300,
            y: -100
          }
        ]}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

`defaultNodes` is an array of objects with a `type`, and an `x` and `y` position, relative to the center of the editor. If everything has gone according to plan, you should have an editor that looks like this:
